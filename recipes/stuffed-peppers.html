<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>long grain white rice</li><html></html>
    <li>Bell peppers</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>ground beef</li>
    <li>yellow onion and fresh garlic</li>
    <li>canned petite diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>tomato sauce</li>
    <li>italian seasoning</li>
    <li>fresh parsley</li>
    <li>mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cook rice according to package instructions.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Meanwhile, trim about 1/4-inch from tops of bell peppers and then remove stems, ribs and seeds. Fill a baking dish just large enough to fit peppers with about 1/2-inch of water.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Place peppers upside down in water, cover tightly with foil and bake 20 minutes.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Meanwhile heat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over-medium high 
    heat</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Add onion and saute 3 minutes. Move onions to one far side of the skillet.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Add beef in chunks, season with salt and pepper then let sear until browned on bottom, about 2 - 3 minutes.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Break up beef and toss with onions and continue to cook 2 minutes, add garlic and cook until beef is cooked through about 1 minute longer. 
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Remove from heat, drain off excess fat (I like to tilt skillet to one side and dab up excess fat using tongs and paper towels).</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Stir in tomatoes, half of the tomato sauce (about 1/2 cup), cooked rice, parsley, Italian seasoning and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ol>
